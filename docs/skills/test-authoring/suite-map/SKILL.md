# Suite Map and Coverage

Load when: deciding which suite to add a test to, checking existing coverage, or reviewing @future gaps.

## When to Use

- Choosing the correct suite for new coverage
- Determining which image variants run a suite
- Updating scenario counts after feature-file changes
- Verifying variant-specific tag semantics such as `@bluefin` and `@dakota_only`

## When NOT to Use

- GNOME AT-SPI implementation details → use `gnome.md`
- Behave step-authoring patterns or collision avoidance → use `behave.md`
- CI workflow internals or reusable action behavior → use `e2e-workflow.md`

## Core Process

1. Identify the suite affected by the change.
2. Confirm the suite/image matrix before adding variant-specific coverage.
3. Verify the correct scenario tags for that image family.
4. Update the coverage snapshot and per-suite counts when scenario totals change.
5. Cross-check the same totals in `docs/qa-review.md` before opening the PR.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It is only one scenario, the counts can wait." | Coverage drift compounds quickly; `suite-map.md` and `docs/qa-review.md` are co-authoritative. |
| "The tag name is obvious." | Variant gating is implemented in suite hooks; confirm the actual tag semantics before writing image-specific scenarios. |
| "Another skill file already mentions this suite." | This file is the source for suite-to-image mapping and coverage totals. |

## Red Flags

- Scenario totals changed but `suite-map.md` was not updated
- A variant-specific scenario was added without checking whether the image actually runs that suite
- A new tag was used without documenting its meaning here
- `suite-map.md` and `docs/qa-review.md` disagree on counts

## Verification

- [ ] Suite/image matrix still matches the intended coverage
- [ ] Variant tag semantics match the actual suite hook behavior
- [ ] Scenario totals here match `docs/qa-review.md`
- [ ] Notes describe timeless operating rules, not session history

> Coverage snapshot here and in `docs/qa-review.md` are co-authoritative — update both when scenario counts or gap status change.

## Variant matrix

Which suites run on which image. Any bootc/ostree GNOME image can run via the GitHub Action.

| Suite | `bluefin` | `bluefin-gdx` | `bluefin-nvidia-open` | `dakota` | `bazzite` | `gnomeos` | `flatcar` | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|

**GitHub Action consumers**:
```yaml
uses: <image-org>/testsuite/.github/workflows/e2e.yml@v1
with:
  image: <your-bootc-image>
  suites: smoke,common   # smoke and common each auto-shard into two parallel jobs
```
Passing `suites: smoke` expands to `smoke-a` + `smoke-b`, and `suites: common` expands to `common-a` + `common-b`. Both cut wall time by ~50%. New `.feature` files in these suites are picked up automatically.

GitHub Action suites (`smoke`, `vanilla-gnome`, `bazzite`, `developer`, `dx`, `software`, `common`, `lifecycle`) run on `ubuntu-latest`.
`security` and `hardware` (SSH-mode) are not yet in the GHA action (epics #43/#44).

Any bootc/ostree GNOME image can plug in `smoke` and `common` as a portable health gate — no Bluefin-specific knowledge required. See `README.md` → "For other bootc image maintainers" for minimum image requirements.

## PR gate model

- All consumer repos should gate on the `smoke` suite only.
- Nightly CI is gone; PR gates are now the only CI signal for promotion decisions.
- `e2e.yml` now caches OCI layers by image digest to speed repeated runs.
- For workflow internals, cache behavior, and troubleshooting, see [`docs/skills/ci-ops/e2e-workflow/SKILL.md`](../../ci-ops/e2e-workflow/SKILL.md).


**Trigger a lifecycle run manually**:
Go to **[<image-org>/actions → Actions → bootc Upgrade and Rollback Test → Run workflow](https://github.com/<image-org>/actions/actions/workflows/upgrade-test.yml)**.
Set `image` (e.g. `ghcr.io/<readonly-upstream>/bluefin:latest`), `suites: lifecycle`, `chunked_enabled: false`.
Set `chunked_enabled: true` once `ghcr.io/<image-org>/bluefin:latest` ships zstd:chunked layers.

> **For lifecycle runs, use `upgrade-test.yml` in `<image-org>/actions`** — it
> calls `e2e.yml` cross-repo and exposes the lifecycle-specific inputs (`chunked_enabled`,
> `test_ref`). `manual.yml` in this repo works for non-lifecycle suites (startup_failure
> was fixed in PR #245 by removing the `@main` ref suffix from the `uses:` line — the
> bare local path `uses: ./.github/workflows/e2e.yml` is fine). For lifecycle, prefer
> `upgrade-test.yml` because it has the richer input set lifecycle needs.

**Registry split:** `bluefin`, `bluefin-nvidia-open`, `dakota` → `ghcr.io/projectbluefin`. `bluefin-gdx`, `bazzite-gnome` → `ghcr.io/ublue-os`.

**Tag notes:**
- `bluefin`: `testing` (pre-release) + `stable` + `lts-testing` + `lts`
- `bluefin-gdx`: `stream10` = lts equivalent; `stream10-testing` = pre-release
- `bluefin-nvidia-open` / `bazzite-gnome`: `testing` + `stable`
- `dakota`: `testing` + `latest`

**Why these assignments:**
- `bluefin` does not ship GNOME Software (it ships Bazaar — `io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar`, a Flatpak software center) → the GNOME Software navigation scenarios are tagged `@future` (#176); Bazaar CLI presence/info/remote coverage is active in `bazaar.feature` and Bazaar config integrity coverage is active in `bazaar_config.feature`
- `bazzite` is not vanilla GNOME → only the bazzite suite runs against it (no vanilla-gnome)
- `bluefin-nvidia-open` is used because nvidia-open is built daily; nvidia services (`nvidia-persistenced`, `ublue-nvctk-cdi`) are in `IGNORED_FAILED_UNITS_IN_VM` — they always fail in QEMU without a physical GPU

## Scenario tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `@smoke_suite` | Runs as part of the standard smoke suite |
| `@bluefin` | Smoke scenario runs only when the image name contains `bluefin`; smoke `environment.py` skips it elsewhere |
| `@dakota_only` | Smoke scenario runs only when the image name contains `dakota`; smoke `environment.py` skips it elsewhere |
| `@dx_only` / `@developer_suite` | DX variant only |
| `@nvidia_only` | NVIDIA variant only |
| `@flatcar_suite` | Flatcar OS only |
| `@hardware_emulation` | Requires full-hw VM spec (TPM, audio, watchdog) |
| `@pending` | Placeholder coverage gap; intentionally skipped until a valid harness exists |
| `@future` | Not yet implemented or blocked on infra |
| `@homed_migration` | systemd-homed migration scenarios; dakota lifecycle; SSH-mode; skip-safe when homed absent |
| `@regression` | Anchors a known incident regression guard; must remain active indefinitely |
| `@kde_smoke` | KDE Plasma smoke-suite identifier; used by `e2e.yml` suite registration (#645) |
| `@informational` | Bake-period tier; scenario runs and reports results but does not gate promotion until promoted to `@critical` |

## Coverage snapshot

486 scenarios across 63 feature files: 382 active, 0 quarantined, 104 `@future`/`@pending`/`@hardware_blocked`
(mechanical recount 2026-08-07 after the quarantine-debt cleanup in #679).

> **Quarantine backlog is now zero.** Every scenario that was quarantined for an
> infrastructure or unshipped-feature blocker was reclassified to `@pending`/`@future` with a
> named blocker, and the one regression guard whose upstream bug is fixed was re-activated.
> `@quarantine` is reserved for genuinely flaky regression coverage under active repair —
> if you reach for it, you are committing to fixing the scenario inside 30 days.

> **Count drift notice.** The previous snapshot claimed 427 scenarios across 52 files. A
> mechanical recount of `tests/*/features/**/*.feature` on `main` found **479 across 61** —
> the snapshot had drifted by ~39 scenarios before any KDE work began. The totals above and
> the Scenarios/Active/Quarantined/Pending columns below are now mechanically derived by
> parsing scenario tags across `tests/*/features/**/*.feature`. A scenario counts once, in
> tag precedence order: `@quarantine` > `@hardware_blocked` > `@future` > `@pending` > active.

| Suite | Scenarios | Active | Quarantined | Pending/Future | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| smoke | 187 | 143 | 0 | 44 | 39 `@pending` flatpak-permission audits blocked on CI never seeding system Flatpaks; MIME handler coverage (Firefox/Papers/Loupe/Text Editor/video); GNOME accessibility (AT-SPI daemon, high-contrast toggle, a11y panel); display fractional/integer scaling via Mutter DisplayConfig; Bluefin desktop identity (Wayland, hardware accel, Dash to Dock); GNOME regression guards in gnome_regression.feature; Dakota sudo-rs privilege and PAM checks |
| developer | 19 | 7 | 0 | 12 | 6 brew + 6 ptyxis now `@pending`: `brew-setup.service` masked in CI (#487) and the ptyxis AT-SPI restart issue (#368) |
| software | 23 | 16 | 0 | 7 | Bazaar launch + search + CLI presence/info/remote + config YAML validation active on bluefin; Bazaar UI tests rewritten for actual Bazaar layout; CLI (Flathub remote + permissions DB) active on all images; upstream GNOME Software scenarios are `@future` (#176) |
| common | 116 | 97 | 0 | 19 | Signing assertions `@future` pending the ublue-os→projectbluefin policy migration; flatpak model/state, dconf defaults, immutability and portal socket checks `@pending` on CI infra; Flatpak model + state; XDG portal health + integration; container runtime (podman); polkit rules; shell env + sourcing; system scripts; ujust recipes; GSettings/dconf defaults; immutable OS integrity (no layered RPMs, /usr read-only, bootc status); desktop entries; signing assertions |
| vanilla-gnome | 13 | 13 | 0 | 0 | Baseline GNOME Shell parity check; runs on any GNOME image |
| lifecycle | 27 | 25 | 0 | 2 | bootc upgrade / rollback / migration; pin + switch are `@future` (pin races the staged-deployment writer; switch needs a valid alternate image ref) |
| hardware | 13 | 13 | 0 | 0 | udev rules syntax validation (ZSA, Apple SuperDrive, Framework 16, AMD s2idle, Wooting, VIIA); emulated peripherals driven by shared SSH steps |
| security | 15 | 15 | 0 | 0 | cosign verify: projectbluefin (bluefin, lts, dakota) + ublue-os (latest, LTS, DX, nvidia, GTS, DX-nvidia, negative) |
| bazzite | 20 | 20 | 0 | 0 | Extension presence + shell behaviour |
| dx | 15 | 10 | 0 | 5 | distrobox enter, JupyterLab, brew, mise×2 — infra gaps, all `@pending` |
| nvidia | 12 | 0 | 0 | 12 | `@future` / `@hardware_blocked` until GPU passthrough exists in the lab |
| flatcar | 13 | 12 | 0 | 1 | boot (7 active) + lifecycle (5 active); 1 `@future` (boot from installed target disk — needs KubeVirt boot-order support in `projectbluefin/lab`) |
| kde-smoke | 13 | 13 | 0 | 0 | Plasma session, D-Bus services, AT-SPI tree, KWin output, one KCM, Dolphin, Konsole, Kickoff; all `@informational` |

## Known coverage gaps

| Area | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bazaar / Flatpak management GUI | High | Bazaar CLI/config integrity coverage active; GUI navigation pending GNOME 50 AT-SPI re-validation |
| Flatpak permission management | Low | Flatseal / per-app permissions not exercised |
| OOBE / first-boot | Low | Initial user setup flow not covered |
| `ujust toggle-updates` | Medium | Blocked upstream in `projectbluefin/common`. `update.just` declares `toggle-updates ACTION="prompt":` but never reads `ACTION`. On images with `bctl` the recipe `exec`s `bctl --screen updates`, a GUI panel; only without `bctl` does it fall back to a `gum choose` prompt, which blocks non-interactive runs. Neither branch offers a non-interactive entry point. Scenario stays `@pending @wip` in `common_ujust.feature`. Next step: `projectbluefin/common` must honour `ACTION`; tracked in `projectbluefin/testsuite#499`. |
| uupd conditional suppression | Medium | Battery and metered-network checks are not covered: uupd reads UPower and NetworkManager system-bus properties, while testsuite has no supported isolated state-injection contract. Do not use `/sys/class/power_supply` or GNOME proxy settings as substitutes. Next step: add a lab/image-owned simulation hook, then cover the upstream `/etc/uupd/config.json` contract. |

| Screenshot portal PNG (×1) | common | `@pending` | portal backend emits no usable Request::Response headlessly |

### Reclassified in #679 (formerly `@quarantine`)

Quarantine is for flaky regression coverage that will be repaired soon. All 90 quarantined
scenarios were blocked on infrastructure or unshipped features rather than flakiness, so 89
were converted to `@pending`/`@future` with a named blocker and 1 (the composefs capability
regression guard) was re-activated because its upstream bug — projectbluefin/dakota#841 — is
closed. The highest-signal conversions are listed below; the rest appear in the
skipped-coverage table above.

| Scenario | Suite | New tag | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| brew (×6) | developer | `@pending` | `brew-setup.service` masked in `e2e.yml` (#487) |
| ptyxis: `@brew` (×1) | developer | `@pending` | brew must be initialized first (#487) |
| ptyxis: `@input`, `@podman`, `@regression`, `@new_tab`, `@close` (×5) | developer | `@pending` | AT-SPI restart issue in CI (#368) — ptyxis reopens between scenarios but the new process isn't reliably accessible |
| distrobox enter (×1) | dx | `@pending` | pulls `fedora:latest`; no pre-pull in CI, times out |
| JupyterLab (×1) | dx | `@pending` | not preinstalled in DX image |
| brew + mise (×3) | dx | `@pending` | `brew-setup.service` masked (#487) — mise uses brew-installed shims |
| ujust report confirm validation (×1) | smoke | `@pending` | `just` template change not in the booted image; awaiting rebuild |
| GNOME Software navigation/regression/close (×6) | software | `@future` | Bluefin ships Bazaar, not GNOME Software (#176) |
| flatpak install/uninstall round-trip (×1) | software | `@future` | gnomeos/GNOME 50 startup path unverified (#176); also slow network I/O |
| common signing (×2) | common | `@future` | signing policy not yet enforced upstream; mid-migration ublue-os → projectbluefin |
| bootc pin (×1) | lifecycle | `@future` | `bootc pin` races the staged-deployment writer in a fresh QEMU install |
| bootc switch (×1) | lifecycle | `@future` | mutates VM image variant; needs cross-variant golden-disk testing |

## @future inventory

Find remaining stubs:
```bash
just list-stubs
# or
grep -r "@future" tests/*/features/*.feature
```

Activate a `@future` scenario when all three conditions are met:
1. VM spec supports the required hardware/feature
2. Step implementations are complete
3. Suite runs cleanly via the GHA action

When activating: remove `@future`, update this file's coverage snapshot, update `docs/qa-review.md`.

## smoke vs vanilla-gnome

`smoke=failed` + `vanilla-gnome=passed` → Bluefin regression.  
`smoke=failed` + `vanilla-gnome=failed` → upstream GNOME issue.  
`vanilla-gnome` runs exclusively against `quay.io/gnome_infrastructure/gnome-build-meta:gnomeos-latest` — the official upstream GNOME OS bootc image — so results are directly comparable to what GNOME ships.  
Comparison commands and manual inspection procedure → `docs/runbook.md`.
