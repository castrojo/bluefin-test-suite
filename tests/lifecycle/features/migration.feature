Feature: Migration from ublue-os/bluefin to projectbluefin/bluefin
  Validates that users can migrate from the legacy ublue-os/bluefin image
  (built with rpm-ostree / ublue-os/legacy-rechunker) to the new
  projectbluefin/bluefin image (built with chunkah), and can safely roll
  back to the legacy image if needed.

  These scenarios are designed to run with:
    image: ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:latest
  via the projectbluefin/actions upgrade-test workflow:
    uses: projectbluefin/actions/.github/workflows/upgrade-test.yml@v1
    with:
      image: ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:latest
      suites: lifecycle

  The migration exercises the chunkah OCI layer format transition: the legacy
  image uses rpm-ostree chunked format (ublue-os/legacy-rechunker) while the
  projectbluefin image uses chunkah. A successful switch and rollback confirms
  bootc can handle the format boundary in both directions.

  The target image is parameterized via the MIGRATION_TARGET env var
  (default: ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:stable). Override it in the
  workflow or locally to test against a different target.

  Background:
    * Bluefin VM is booted and reachable over SSH

  @migration @switch
  Scenario: bootc switch migrates from ublue-os/bluefin to projectbluefin/bluefin
    # Pre-condition: confirm we're actually on the legacy source image before switching.
    # This guards against a no-op if the workflow was accidentally invoked on the
    # wrong starting image, which would silently pass without testing the boundary.
