Feature: Bazaar GUI deep navigation
  Validates Bazaar search and category navigation on Bluefin images.
  Complements bazaar_ui.feature (launch + tab visibility) by exercising
  the Curated tab, the Search tab, and search-result interaction.
  Scenarios skip automatically on images where Bazaar is absent via the
  existing _skip_if_no_atspi guard and the _has_bazaar() runtime check.

  GNOME 50 AT-SPI note: the Search tab is a toggle button in GNOME 50 but
  a page tab in GNOME 46/48. Both roles are covered by BAZAAR_TAB_ROLES in
  the software steps module, so no per-scenario workaround is needed.

  Background:
    * Launch Bazaar via fallback targets
    * Bazaar main window is accessible
    * Bazaar main content is loaded
